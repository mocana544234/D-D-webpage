            Grimlock is the last remaining member of his village. He hails from a tribe in the far eastern mountains of Brourd called “Rodulr.” In the common tongue it roughly translates to the fierce ones. Grimlock's father, Kotram, was a highly ranked soldier in the villages forces and taught him how to fight while his mother, Arterla, was a farmer and taught him how to live off the land and survive. His village was attacked by a warrior of dark legendary tales among the dragonborns and dragons alike. The Buster Blader, with his royal purple armor and greatsword he slayed every man, woman, and child in the village and with every dragonborn killed he only got strong. Kotram was the last warrior standing even though he fought well he still couldn't make a dent in the warrior's armor. The Buster Blader shoved the greatsword through Kotram's torso then chopped off his head. Grimlock seeing this with his own eyes, couldn't move when the Buster Blader locked his eyes on the young dragonborn. He approached Grimlock and raised his sword and with a swift motion he slashes at Grimlock but the hit was blocked by his mother going right through her shoulder. With her last dying words Arterla says to her son in dragon tongue, “Qtlod rodulr urd. (Live little fierce one.) Grimlock runs for his father's sword and isn't strong enough to pick it up but manages to and aims it at the Buster Blader. Grimlock swing the sword violently and recklessly the fearless warrior backs up and slashes a scar on Grimlock’s right eye but misses the eyeball completely and on purpose. Grimlock falls back in pain and the warrior picks up Grimlock by the head and whispers in his ear, “I will allow you to live.” He knocks out Grimlock with the handle of his sword. The young dragonborn wakes up and his village is burned down and left to ashes. He now travels west constantly training in different combat styles to get strong but ultimately will run into the Buster Blader again and when that happens Grimlock will avenge his village and fight for those who are too weak to fight. Grimlock has a soft spot for orphans and the abandoned. For no child or creature should have to experience losing loved ones. It has been 80 human years since his village was turned into ash. 80 years seem like a long time but Grimlock is equivalent to a mid 26 year old human. He's searching for this legendary warrior and claim his head.
